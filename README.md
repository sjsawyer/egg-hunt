# Egg-Hunt

Just a simple script to find a bunch of eggs hidden around a website. Nothing
more to be said really.

## Usage

Ensure the ``DOMAIN`` environment variable is set. After installing the
dependencies, e.g. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, simply run the
script:

```python
python3 main.py
```

and enjoy your eggs. Unfortnately they only come hard boiled.
